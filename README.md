# Datafeedr Product Sets Plugin

A WordPress plugin to build sets of products from the Datafeedr API to import into your website.

A Product Set is a collection of related products. Once you create a Product Set, the products in that set will be imported into your website (via an importer plugin). The Product Set is also responsible for updating those imported products with the newest information at an interval you choose.

The [*Datafeedr Product Sets* plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/datafeedr-product-sets/) currently integrates with the following plugins:

* [Datafeedr WooCommerce Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/datafeedr-woocommerce-importer/)
* [Datafeedr API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/datafeedr-api/)
